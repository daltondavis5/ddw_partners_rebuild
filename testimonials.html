          <p class="testimonial">"I too am a customer and friend of Ryan's. Ryan has been such a great adviser on my car purchases throughout the years, sometimes not even making anything on the advice just to do the right thing by me. You just do not get people like that in business very often. I purchased an R8 from him and recently picked up a 2015 GT3 from him as well. Ryan made sure the car was absolutely perfect before delivering it to me. He went as far as having a portion of the front bumper paint protection replaced because it was not 100% perfect. I will never buy another car from anyone else, he is my guy. Glad to see you a part of this community Ryan!" <strong>-Ryan Rayburn</strong></p>

          <p align="right" class="testimonial">"I just completed a purchase with Ryan for a 2005 Viper Copperhead. I found Ryan to be true and honest and easy to work with. This was not your typical vehicle purchase, I was in SC and the car was in AZ. I was a little apprehensive at first so I had a friend from a car club who lived in AZ go and check the car out. He reported back to me and told me that the car was everything Ryan said it was. He was impressed with Ryan and his facilities, not to mention his inventory. I generally donâ€™t wright reviews but feel that Ryan earned this one, I would recommend DDW and Ryan to a friend." <strong>-James Pyjas</strong></p>

He even arranged for shipping from AZ all the way to Atlanta. When the cars arrived they were in even better condition than what I was able to see in pictures. Thank you Ryan!! Well done!!!!" <strong>-Ryan Hardwick</strong></p>

          <p align="right" class="testimonial">"I just purchased a 2011 Cayman S from Ryan at DDW Partners. He was super responsive and helpful having the car inspected and making himself available for a trusted friend to come drive it. I bought the car "sight unseen" and felt very comfortable with the purchase before and after seeing it. I took the car to the track to drive only three days after returning to California and it drove flawlessly." <strong>-James Hall</strong></p>

          <p align="right" class="testimonial">"We live several hundred miles from Scottsdale so we were worried about how we would be treated because we had not had any success with two other car dealers over several months. It was a long way to drive if we couldn't reach an agreement about the cars. But Ryan was very honest, friendly, very cooperative and very patient with our questions. He explained the negotiations in detail and described the attributes of our new car fully. We purchased our new Corvette from DDW for a very reasonable price and are very pleased with the treatment we received." <strong>-Connie & Jim Gentry</strong></p>
